Also, the source files are usually small in size, and `github` is sufficient for storage. \n\nFor data files, we use `googledrive` for archiving purposes. Also, the data files are usually large in size, and `googledrive` is perfect for this.\n\n:::\n\n### General principles\n\n1. For each project, create a subfolder in the shared google drive.\n2. The subfolder should have a concise but indicative name, for example, jtao-rotation1\n3. Create sub-subfolders as necessary\n4. Include a README file to briefly introduce the background of the data and the structure of the data; also in the README file, include a link to the git repo of the source files.\n5. ...\n\n### For use with the cluster\n\n1. Follow the [instructions from Research Computing](https://asurc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/61833262/Google+Drive+rclone) to configure your `rclone` on agave and link `rclone` to the group shared google drive.\n2. Include a line of `rclone copy command` in the batch file (as shown in the [template](./agave-template.qmd)), and follow the instructions to automate the archiving process immediately after your simulation is completed.\n3. If you prefer to use GUI, you can use [Globus](https://asurc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/201490433/Google+Drive+Globus).  \n\n\n### For use outside of the cluster\n\n1. Archive early, archive often.\n2. Follow the general principles.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig.width":7,"fig.height":5,"fig.format":"retina","fig.dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","code-fold":"none","code-summary":"Code","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-tools":false,"merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"from":"markdown","standalone":true,"to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"rclone-gd.html"},"metadata":{"theme":"cosmo","title":"Data Archiving using Google Drive"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
