    "text": "Warning: in order to use git as instructed below, you need to configure git first on your computer. See the workflow website for detailed information. 1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. chgpu_agave_template 2. Above the file list, click Use this template, which usually appears in green. 4. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description. The project name should be concise but indicative, e.g., “sample_prep”. For a more comprehensive instruction on how to create a repo from a template, check here Note: instead of using “template”, you can also “fork” the repo and then update the settings such as repo name etc. There are some differences though, as discussed here\n\nOn your own computer, clone the new repo.\nRename the cpp,json, sh files with your project name. For example, repose.cpp –> sample_prep.cpp; repose.json –> sample_prep.json; and repose.sh –> sample_prep.json\nEdit the source cpp and json files for your project.\nUpdate the CMakeList.txt file:\nReplace the word repose with your project name.\nFor example, change\n\nset(MY_PROJECT repose)\nto\nset(MY_PROJECT sample_prep)\n\nUpdate the repose.sh file\n\n\nSearch and replace all instances of repose with your project name, e.g., sample_prep\nUpdate the slurm requests as shown in the example bash script.\n\n\nCommit the changes and push to the github repo.\n\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m 'update to sample_prep'\ngit push\n\nRepeat the steps the same as in the “test run” example above, except that you work on the new project repo."
