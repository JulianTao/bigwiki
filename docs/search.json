The shortname can be used latter in lieu of the whole URL, for example git fetch shortname. This is useful when collaborating.\nIf you need to change the url of a remote, you can use,\ngit remote set-url <url>\n\nFetching and Pulling from the remotes\n\ngit fetch <remote>\nThis command will pulls down all the data from the remote project that you don’t have yet. You can then merge in any branches from that remote.\nAlternatively, if your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use git pull to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch.\n\nPushing from local branch to remotes\n\ngit push <remote> <branch> \nWith this command, you can share your local branch by pushing it to the remote. You need to specify the remote and branch that you want to push to. You also need to have the write access to the remote.\n\nRenaming and Removing remotes\n\ngit remote rename <oldname> <newname>       # rename a remote from <oldname> to <newname>\ngit remote remove <shortname>               # remote the remote <shorname>"

Also, the source files are usually small in size, and github is sufficient for storage.\nFor data files, we use googledrive for archiving purposes. Also, the data files are usually large in size, and googledrive is perfect for this.\n\n\n\nGeneral principles\n\nFor each project, create a subfolder in the shared google drive.\nThe subfolder should have a concise but indicative name, for example, jtao-rotation1\nCreate sub-subfolders as necessary\nInclude a README file to briefly introduce the background of the data and the structure of the data; also in the README file, include a link to the git repo of the source files.\n…\n\n\n\nFor use with the cluster\n\nFollow the instructions from Research Computing to configure your rclone on agave and link rclone to the group shared google drive.\nInclude a line of rclone copy command in the batch file (as shown in the template), and follow the instructions to automate the archiving process immediately after your simulation is completed.\nIf you prefer to use GUI, you can use Globus.\n\n\n\nFor use outside of the cluster\n\nArchive early, archive often.\nFollow the general principles."

For example, repose.cpp –> sample_prep.cpp; repose.json –> sample_prep.json; and repose.sh –> sample_prep.json\nEdit the source cpp and json files for your project.\nUpdate the CMakeList.txt file:\nReplace the word repose with your project name.\nFor example, change\n\nset(MY_PROJECT repose)\nto\nset(MY_PROJECT sample_prep)\n\nUpdate the repose.sh file\n\n\nSearch and replace all instances of repose with your project name, e.g., sample_prep\nUpdate the slurm requests as shown in the example bash script.\n\n\nCommit the changes and push to the github repo.\n\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m 'update to sample_prep'\ngit push\n\nRepeat the steps the same as in the “test run” example above, except that you work on the new project repo.\nCongratulations, you run your first ChronoGPU project on Agave."
