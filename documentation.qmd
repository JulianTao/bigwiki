## WIP
This is a work in progress. The templates will be updated and more information will be provide.

The goal is to conduct reproducible research, to report and document data and results in a reproducible manner.

We suggest to use Rmarkdown and/or Quarto.

## Rmarkdown 

* [Rmarkdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
* [BiG Rmarkdown Templates](https://github.com/JulianTao/bigrmd)

## Quarto

* [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/)
